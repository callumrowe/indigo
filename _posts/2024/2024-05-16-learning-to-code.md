I started with a Udemy course and made a couple of Hello World and math scripts. Useless. 

Then I did a Udemy course that introduced HTML, CSS and Javascript, Node, ExpressJS, the request-response cycle, databases and ORMs, APIs. It was simple. I made a v lightweight app that didn't do more than CRUD a few things in a Mongo DB. But I hacked Stripe into it for fun. I could use a test credit card, and create a subscription. 

Then I did another Udemy course a year later to learn VueJS.

Then I discovered Supabase. 

Then I discovered Nuxt, Vercel.

I have lost count of the number of times I've created a silly little app that doesn't do much more than CRUD some shit. 

Then along came ChatGPT.

At this point, I feel like I know enough about web apps and enough about talking to ChatGPT to basically hack together prototypes of ideas.
