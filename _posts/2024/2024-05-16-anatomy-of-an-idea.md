Basically.... what is the product tool? How did it come about? What do I think about the nature of product ideas, features, etc etc.

## What is an idea?

In the context of products, SaaS, technology, business, design, etc.... 

- What is an idea?
- What can be done to an idea?
- What happens as a result of an idea?
- How are they managed (through their entire lifecycle)?

And in the context of lean product and fast-moving SaaS, what is the core thing we do? 
We quickly test ideas to see what might have merit and outcomes, and then we do the least work possible to get that outcome.

Hypotheses/assumptions/bets are also ideas. 

The entire product is an idea. For products that have already been built (I'm not going into the definitions of things like MVP, MMP, etc) and all I mean is some code is in production and running and users are using, the idea is reality - but it is still an idea.

## What do we do to ideas?

Discovery involves finding a path through a messy space. Distilling information, data & opinions into what really matters - the ideas that have the most merit and potential.

Execution involves "scoping down" ideas. Finding the smallest possible, surgical changes to the pre-existing ideas that underpin the product.

I think of product management in this sense like a sculptor. Starting with a rough, unprocessed piece of shit and slowly taking away stuff until they reach a sweet spot.



## What's hard about this work?

When working in a team, and with people around the team who contribute to this work and also who require the work to do theirs, this can be hectic. Questions, clarifications, confusion, etc etc. The entire role of PM is defined to shepherd this process through a mix of people skills/stakeholder management, language translation and communicating/managing.



# The product tool...

What if there was a tool what Git or Github is to engineers, but for the ideas, bets, requests etc are to product people? Something that looks across our entire product (also an idea) and shows where and how we're surgically making changes to our ideas?

Enter *kinetic*, the working name for a product that makes this easier. Here's a screenshot.

As much as some people think, or try to make it, building software products is **not** a predictable, linear process. Product management and design specifically are messy art forms. Trying things, exploring directions, but eventually zeroing in on a core kernel of value and the solution that enables it, takes time and effort and takes you on a wild journey.

This product tool is different to all others I've ever come across because it entirely embraces this notion.

Its simple in that all it does is capture everything involved in that process of chiselling down to the kernel - but in a way that basically builds up a product brief as you go
