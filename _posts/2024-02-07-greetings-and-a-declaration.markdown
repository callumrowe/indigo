**Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the internet**. I'll start by saying I'm a talker and not a writer. I write pretty well out of neccesity, but my best *thinking* happens when I get my thoughts out, out loud. So this is both an exercise in writing-to-think, and an activity that keeps me from talking to myself or my partner about work stuff or my obsessions non-stop. 

I aim for this to be exploratory and forever incomplete. I'm not writing for anyone but myself. And to unashamedly state the obvious, this stuff won't be polished essays or retweetable nuggets of wisdom (not only because I deleted the "Retweet this" button from the Jekyll theme I used for this site). 

I have 10 years of experience with products and projects and technology and humans, but it's been a scrappy, figure-it-out kind of ride. I'm not going to pretend I have answers or even write like I know exactly what I'm talking about. I'm figuring this out as I go, fueled by a bit of creativity and a fuck-it mentality.
